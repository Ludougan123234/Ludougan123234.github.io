Hello there! This is a notebook where you'll be introduced to analyzing quantitative data with the R programming language. In this notebook, I will only help you learn the R commands to help you with your data analysis. No prior knowledge in coding is needed! I'll try to explain things in simpler terms. However, if you still find something confusing, or even find erroneous information on this website/notebook, please email me at: randy19981223@gmail.com and ask for clarifications/revisions. Let's start learning!
